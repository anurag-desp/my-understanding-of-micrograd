# My Understanding of Micrograd

- This is my attempt and notes on Micrograd I learned from the absolute legend [Andrej Karpathy](https://github.com/karpathy).

- The code is pretty much the same, but I have added a bunch of things from the video that were new and cool to me. There are some explanation of my own that I used to figure somethings out. I hope this repo can be helpful. It certainly was to me!
